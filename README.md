A database managing tool that can manage a MySQL and MSAccess database, developed in Java using JavaFX and SceneBuilder.


The DB-Connect provides a simple easy to use graphical user interface (Implemented solely in Java FX particularly FXML) to work on relational databases over the network.

Since it is being built in JAVA it can access JDBC compliant databases running on any machine and allows remote access to multiple databases.
